## Overview
MyPCStats lets you track your lifetime computer inputs with new ways to view your keyboard and mouse input data.

#### Mouse

Fill up your screen with color by using the 24 hour click map, an overlay that shows you your last 24 hours of click history with colored dots. There are 5 different toggle buttons to change the way the data is displayed:

- **High Contrast:** the button with the 2 circles with a lined cross section makes the overlay darker, allowing easier viewing of the dots.
- **Animation:** Toggles the animation of drawing each dot individually.
- **Green Dot:** The green dots signify left click inputs from the mouse, and the green dot button can be used to turn them off or on.
- **Red Dot:** The red dots signify the right click inputs from the mouse, and the red dot button is used to turn them on or off.
- **Yellow Dot:** The yellow dot is for middle click inputs and the button toggles them on or off.

Press the esc button to leave the overlay.

## Download
[Download the latest version of MyPCStats](https://github.com/LukeBarcenas/MyPCStats/releases/latest) - Get the latest version here.

#### Step 1
Head to the latest release page (linked above) and download the latest release by clicking on the "MyPCStats.zip" link in the assets section of the page.

Open the zip file and move the MyPCStats folder to an accessible location (Desktop is easiest).

#### Step 3
In the MyPCStats folder, open the "scripts" folder and double click "runStatsCollector" and go through the security process of opening the script.

#### Step 4
With the script running, your inputs are being added, and you can view your data by opening the "MyPCStats" app!

#### Step 5 (For always having inputs collected)
On your keyboard, press "Win+r" to open the command window, and type "shell:startup" to go to your startup folder

Head back to the "scripts" folder in the "MyPCStats" folder and make a shortcut of the "runStatsCollector" by right clicking the file, pressing "Show more options", then "Create shortcut".

Drag this newly created shortcut into the "startup" folder and you are good to go! Your stats should now always be collected on startup.

## Help
#### Data not being collected?
In the MyPCStats app, go to the homepage in the questions section or the settings and click the link to open the application's folder. Head to the scripts folder and double click "runStatsCollector". Then, stats should start being collected. If you want to have it automatically start, follow step 5 in the download section.
